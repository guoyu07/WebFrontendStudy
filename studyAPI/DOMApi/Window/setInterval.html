	<b>setInterval语法如下：</b>
	<p><code>
	var intervalID = window.setInterval(func, delay[, param1, param2, ...]);
	var intervalID = window.setInterval(code, delay);
	</code></p>
	<b>参数如下：</b>
	<ul>
		<li>intervalID is a unique interval ID you can pass to clearInterval().</li>
		<li>func is the function you want to be called repeatedly.</li>
		<li>code, in the alternate syntax, is the string of code you want to be executed repeatedly. (This syntax is not recommended for the same reasons that using eval() should be avoided.)</li>
		<li>delay is the number of milliseconds (thousandths of a second) that the setInterval() function should wait before each call to func. As with setTimeout, there is a minimum delay enforced.</li>
		<li>param1, param2, and so forth, are additional parameters that are passed through to the function specified by func.</li>
	</ul>
